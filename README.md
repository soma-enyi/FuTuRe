# Stellar Remittance Platform

A cross-border remittance application built on the Stellar blockchain, enabling fast and low-cost international money transfers.

This repository includes both frontend and backend services for building a Stellar payment experience.

## Features

- Create Stellar accounts
- Check account balances
- Send XLM payments
- Low transaction fees (~$0.00001)
- Fast settlement (3-5 seconds)

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js + Express + Stellar SDK
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Blockchain: Stellar (Testnet)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure backend environment:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

See `backend/CONFIGURATION.md` for environment options, validation rules, and optional encrypted secrets.

3. Configure frontend environment (optional):

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` to your production API endpoint when deploying to a CDN or different domain. Leave empty for development (Vite proxy handles `/api` requests to `localhost:3001`).

4. Start development servers:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on http://localhost:3001
Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Click "Create Account" to generate a new Stellar keypair
2. Account is automatically funded on testnet via Friendbot
3. Check balance to see your XLM
4. Send payments to other Stellar addresses

## Testnet Setup

### Friendbot

Friendbot is Stellar's automated account-funding service for the testnet. It credits any new (or unfunded) Stellar public key with **10,000 test XLM** at no cost, letting you start testing payments immediately without real funds.

Fund an account via the API directly:

```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

Or use the bundled helper script (see `scripts/fund-testnet-account.sh`):

```bash
bash scripts/fund-testnet-account.sh GCEZWKCA5VLDNRLN3RPRJMRZOX3Z6G5CHCGZWM9CQJHD9QDNHXHXN
```

The app calls Friendbot automatically when you click **Create Account** in the UI.

### Testnet Limitations

- **Quarterly resets** — the Stellar testnet is wiped roughly every three months. All accounts, balances, and transaction history are deleted. You must re-fund accounts after each reset.
- Test XLM has no monetary value and cannot be transferred to mainnet.
- Friendbot is only available on testnet; it does not exist on mainnet.

### Testnet vs. Mainnet Configuration

| Setting | Testnet | Mainnet |
|---|---|---|
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` | `mainnet` |
| `HORIZON_URL` | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://horizon.stellar.org` |
| Network passphrase | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` | `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015` |
| Friendbot available | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Real funds | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

Set `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet` (the default) in `backend/.env` for local development. Change to `mainnet` only for production deployments.

## Next Steps

- Add stablecoin support (USDC)
- Integrate fiat on/off ramps
- Add exchange rate conversion
- Implement KYC/AML compliance
- Add transaction history
- Mobile app development
